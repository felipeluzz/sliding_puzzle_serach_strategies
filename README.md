# Sliding Puzzle Search Strategies

Implementation of four search strategies for the sliding puzzle. The implemented strategies are: Depth-First Search; Breadth-First Search; Iterative deepening depth-first search; And the A* algorithm.

This project was developed as the first assignment of the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals subject of the master's degree course on Computer Science of the Federal University of Pelotas.

To run this project, type "python search_strategies.py [N] [STRATEGY]", where N is the number of rows and columns of the board, and STRATEGY is the search strategy, breadth, depth, iterative or A*.
If you are using the A* strategy, you can also type "manhattan" as the last parameter (after A*) to use the manhattan distance algorithm.
